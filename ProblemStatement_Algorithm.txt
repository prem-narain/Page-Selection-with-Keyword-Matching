Algorithm for Problem Statement : 

1.Start
    2. Loops through the global list of queries :
        assigns a dictionary and visited array (to avoid repetitive checking)
        3. Loops through each word in query and checks if the word is present or not in global word list
            if not present in global list, word not present in any page. Continues to next word in query.
            if present:
                4. loops through each page's word list that the word contains , accessed from global word dict( value)
                and sends page and query to check SOP.
                5. assigns returned result to the dictionary, which is sorted in the following order :
                sorted in descending order of value(SOP). If values matched then sorted in ascending order of keys(page names).
                6. sends to print function 
7.End.
